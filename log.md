# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 30, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Started my portfolio website. Started using SCSS and configured my IDE (VS Code) to compile it. Managed to finish the landing page, the menu and some responsiveness all around. I still need to make each separate site (about, work and possibly contact)

**Thoughts**: I still need to work on learning the SCSS framework properly, especially the @mixin function

### Day 1: July 31, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Created the about page, and used CSS Grid to align items on it. Also added a function to change the text color to black or white depending on the background color (light/dark themes)

**Thoughts**: Functions on SCSS are useful and fairly easy, CSS Grid is also very useful and versatile, will try to combine it with flexbox later

### Day 2: August 1, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Added the work page where I can showcase any future projects, with this the portfolio is technically finished

**Thoughts**: From now on, every project I create should be showcased here. I also want to remove the '.html' endings on the URLs

### Day 3: August 2, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Started the JavaScript30 course in order to practice JS. Built the first 2 projects

**Thoughts**: this course will be a great practice to get me comfortable with JavaScript

### Day 4: August 3, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Continued with JavaScript30, built the next 3 projects

**Thoughts**: I used datasets on the CSS variables project, looks useful, and will try to implement again to remember it. The array exercise was tough, will have to do it again to make sure the knowledge sticks

Also learned how to use native variables in CSS (instead of the ones on sass) [--foo: #fff;  // var(--foo);]

### Day 5: August 5, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Continued with JavaScript30, built the next project

**Thoughts**: this new project used a lot of regular expressions, another subject I really need to dive into in the near future. This project will be extremely useful in future projects where I want to match a user search with a database.

### Day 7: August 7, 2018
#####

**Today**: No internet today since noon. Tried working on some websites while offline but I noticed I still lean on heavily on documentation and other thing to refresh my memory. Will come back when the internet is fixed

### Day 8: August 10, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Came back to JS30 and worked with HTML5 Canvas for the first time

**Thoughts**: learned the basics of canvas and had fun getting the canvas to draw the way I wanted to. used flags, conditions and a few event listeners to get it to work

### Day 9: August 11, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the next JS30 project, adding multiple selection functionality to a checkbox list when holding shift

**Thoughts**: used flags again to know my place around the objects and worked on a few conditions

### Day 10: August 12, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a project that creates a custom video player controls

**Thoughts**: This was a cool project showcasing another useful way of working with JS to customize the personalized experience of your website

### Day 11: August 13, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Today's project was quite small, so I complemented it with a few hours of Udemy courses on JavaScript

**Thoughts**: today's project consisted in detecting a specific sequence of keys (konami code) on the browser. so basically a rudimentary keylogger, but at least you're not really storing the keystrokes

### Day 12: August 14, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: The project I built today involved adding and removing classes to images to have them slide in when they're in view.

**Thoughts**: Today's project involved working with a debounce function to prevent a scroll event from calling a function too many times. The functions to determine if the image was in view involved some math, but not too complicated luckily

### Day 13: August 15, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Today's exercise involved learning some core JS concepts; the difference between referencing and copying.

**Thoughts**: Being able to differentiate the two will make or break a project, will need to grind this one down.

### Day 14: August 17, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Today's project involved working with local storage and event delegation.

**Thoughts**: local storage was fun and useful, event delegation was a little more obscure

### Day 15: August 18, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Today's project was to make a drop shadow move based on the position of the cursor on the page.

**Thoughts**: There was some math involved on this project in order to prevent some issues with the coordinates of child elements (in relation to the object we're listening to). It also involved more math in order to restrict the movement of the shadow to our defined max value.

### Day 16: August 19, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: I decided to give JS30 a rest and wanted to start a bigger project. The project is a budget application running only on JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: I moved to this bigger and more ambitious project to put in practice some things I’ve been learning on my different courses, specifically planning and writing reusable code (among others)

### Day 17: August 20, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Today I kept working on the Budget Application, and the basic functions are working. It will accept inputs and will display a budget calculation as well as totals

**Thoughts**: This project is really teaching me how to organize the code and work with functions carefully, as well as keeping a good eye on the data and some serious debugging when (never if) something breaks

### Day 18: August 21, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Today I kept working on the Budget Application, and now you're able to delete items.

**Thoughts**: Today’s work taught me how to properly do event delegation and traversing the DOM using '.parentNode'. I know it was only useful because I hard-coded the HTML strings that the app is outputting into the UI. Had some more practive using '.split' and '.map'

### Day 19: August 22, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Today I managed to finish the functionality of the app, the only thing I'd like to add to it are mainly style and CSS changes (might re-write it in SASS).

**Thoughts**: I had to figure out at least 3 bugs in the application that were not only time consuming, but very dubm mistakes like not calling a function properly or misspelling it's name when declaring it. Very very dumb. I need to pay more attention to what I'm doing
