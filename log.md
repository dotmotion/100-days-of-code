# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 30, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Started my portfolio website. Started using SCSS and configured my IDE (VS Code) to compile it. Managed to finish the landing page, the menu and some responsiveness all around. I still need to make each separate site (about, work and possibly contact)

**Thoughts**: I still need to work on learning the SCSS framework properly, especially the @mixin function

### Day 1: July 31, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Created the about page, and used CSS Grid to align items on it. Also added a function to change the text color to black or white depending on the background color (light/dark themes)

**Thoughts**: Functions on SCSS are useful and fairly easy, CSS Grid is also very useful and versatile, will try to combine it with flexbox later

### Day 2: August 1, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Added the work page where I can showcase any future projects, with this the portfolio is technically finished

**Thoughts**: From now on, every project I create should be showcased here. I also want to remove the '.html' endings on the URLs

### Day 4: August 3, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Continued with JavaScript30, built the next 3 projects

**Thoughts**: I used datasets on the CSS variables project, looks useful, and will try to implement again to remember it. The array excercise was tough, will have to do it again to make sure the knowledge sticks

Also learned how to use native variables in CSS (instead of the ones on sass) [--foo: #fff;  // var(--foo);]

### Day 5: August 5, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: Continued with JavaScript30, built the next project

**Thoughts**: this new project used a lot of regular expressions, another subject I really need to dive into in the near future. This project will be extremely useful in future projects where I want to match a user search with a database.

### Day 7: August 7, 2018
#####

**Today's Progress**: I had an internet outage the whole day so no videos, coirses or enev recourses, so offline coding only.

**Thoughts**: offline coding is not for me yet, i still need to read up docume tation and some properties here and there, but this was a nice way of seeing how much i can do on my own (not so much)
