# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started my portfolio website. Started using SCSS and configured my IDE (VS Code) to compile it. Managed to finish the landing page, the menu and some responsiveness all around. I still need to make each separate site (about, work and possibly contact)

**Thoughts:**I still need to work on learning the SCSS framework properly, especially the @mixin function
